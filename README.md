# Shared Notes App

Shared Notes is a simple MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application that allows users to create and share notes with other users. This project is organized as a monorepo for both the frontend and backend components.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adnanavni/shared-notes.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project root:

   ```bash
   cd shared-notes
   ```

3. Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the application

After installing the dependencies, you can run the frontend and backend components separately.

### Frontend

To run the frontend, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev -w app
```

This command launches the development server for the React.js frontend.

### Backend

To run the backend, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev -w server
```

This command starts the Express.js server for the backend.

Note: Ensure that you have MongoDB installed and running, as the application uses MongoDB as its database.
